Project to configure joystick boot and code files using a python based gui for joystickxl based circuit python code.
built ontop of circuitpython code from <https://github.com/fasteddy516/CircuitPython_JoystickXL>
Consider building a yaml config file that gets read into the program so a user doesnt have to input anything they just have to write the config
